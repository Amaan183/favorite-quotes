                    <blockquote>
                        <p>“In a sense, people are our proper occupation. Our job is to do them good and put up with them.
                        But when they obstruct our proper tasks, they become irrelevant to us—like sun, wind, animals. Our actions may be impeded by them, but there can be no impeding our intentions
                        or our dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the
                        obstacle to our acting.The impediment to action advances action.
                        What stands in the way becomes the way.”</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"Pain and suffering are always 
                            inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. 
                            The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth."</p>

                     <blockquote>
                        <p>In some ways suffering ceases to be suffering at the 
                            moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.”</p>

                        <p>“Two things define you: Your patience when you have 
                            nothing and your attitude when you have everything.”</p>

                     <blockquote>
                        <p>“My formula for human greatness is amor fati: 
                            that one wants nothing to be different, not in the future, 
                            not in the past, not for all eternity. Not only to endure what is necessary, 
                            still less to conceal it — all idealism is falseness in the face of necessity — , 
                            but to love it...”</p>

                            Khuda bande se khud pooche bata teri raza kya hai.</p>
